## Code to compute coherent structures for flows on curved surface 
Coherent structures offer a method to quantify the material transport and deformation properties of flows [1](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-fluid-010313-141322). This repo contains MATLAB code to compute coherent structures and Lagrangian deformation for flows on curved surface. Details regarding the method used to compute these quantities is given in the accompanying paper [S. Santhosh et al](). The tutorial on how to use this code is described in the [documentation](https://sreejithsanthosh.github.io/FTLEhub/docs/Tutorials/FTLECurvedSurface.html)
